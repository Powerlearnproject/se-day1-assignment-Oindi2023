Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch computer science that deals with design ,development ,testing and maintainingof softwareapplication
. Its most important in that, it equip learners with knowledge in programming language which is used to build software solution for end users

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) Key milestone is that of 1968- its refer to as the birth of software engineering 
2) 1970 ( object oriented programming) it was the time when (OOP) was developed 
3) 1990 Agile methodology. it marked the development of Agile methodology  like scrum and extreme programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Requirement Analysis.getting what the system need
2) Design. planning the system architecture
3) Implementation.coding the software
4) Testing. Ensuring the software works correctly
5) Maintenance .updating and fixing the sofware  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear sequential model suitable for projects with well defined requirement  while Agile is iterative and incremental ,allowing for flexibility
and continuous improvement
             COMPARISON
   1) Manage projects. both are used to do and manages various project
   2) both are used in coding,debug and maintain software
   3) both provide tools and environment for coding and debuging
      

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1) Software developer. code,debug and maintain software
2) Quality Assurance Engineer. Test the software to ensure quality and functionality
3) Project Manager.Oversees the project ,manages timelines and coordinates team effective 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES AND VCS (visual studio eclipse).Provides tools for coding ,debuging and testing ,enhancing productivity
VCS ( e.g Git).A version control systems manage changes to source code,facilitating collaboration and tracking modification 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Complexity 
2) Changing requirement
3) Tight deadlins
Strategies.Use of Agile methodologies ,continuous integration and thorough documentation 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit testing. Test the individual components or modules
2) Integration testing. Test the interation between the integrated modules
3) System Testing. Test the complete
4) Acceptance Testing.Test if the system meets the business

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering involves crafting inputs(prompt) to AI model to elicit desired output . It is crucial for effective interation
with AI to ensuring clarity and specificity

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. Vague, tell me about a dog
Improved - summary of the behavioral and physiological characteraristics 
Vague.
